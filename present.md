<!-- Slide: Motivation -->
## Motivation

- Households are often portrayed as **central actors** in reducing emissions.
- However, current carbon footprint tools:
  - Rely on **inconsistent system boundaries**
  - Often **double-count emissions**
  - Fail to account for **market feedback** or **investment-induced emissions**
- This leads to:
  - **Misattribution of responsibility**
  - **Ineffective climate policies** targeting only consumer behavior

ðŸ§­ **Goal**: Provide a more accurate, systemic method to assess household carbon footprints by comparing four key models.

<!-- Slide: Research Questions -->
## Research Questions

1.  How do footprint estimates vary across methods when applied to real household data?  
  

2. How does each carbon accounting method estimate and attribute responsibility for household carbon footprints?  
 

3. How do these attribution methods influence policy, and what are the equity implications of their application?
